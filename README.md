This is a repository for my project to create a webpage for a quiz (which will be pulled from an API) which I will display on my Portfolio.


Things to do:

Mention DecodeHTML in readme there can be erroneous questions

change the data URL to be category value with the cat value

keep the URL in the JS

put the API function into its own JS file

mobile accessibility is important

look into media queries and flex boxes
